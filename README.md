# Network-Classifier
In this exercise, i develop a classification service that identifies network devices. This service takes classification rules and communication patterns and produces an output that contains the classification of the network devices. In the process, the service will continuously read the communications patterns and try to match them against existing rules. The output file contains devices and their classification according to the rules they matched.
